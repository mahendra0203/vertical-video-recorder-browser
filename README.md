__Vertical Video Recorder for Browser__

This is a tool to record vertical videos on a browser. It's a Next.js project.

The iPhone camera wasn't supporting my external wired microphone from Boya when recording videos. 
So, I wrote this to utilize the iPhone continuity camera and record vertical videos on a browser.

To run, use:
```javascript
 npm run dev
```

To start recording,

```javascript
http://localhost:3000/record or the configured domain and port
```
